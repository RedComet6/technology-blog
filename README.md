## Description

This is a blog site application. When a user visits the site for the first time, they are presented with the homepage which displays existing blog posts and presents a navigation link to the login/signup page. From any page on the site, a user can click on the Site Name in the upper left of the window to be brought back to the homepage. When a user clicks on one of the existing posts, they are taken to the post's page, which displays the post's information and associated comments. A user must be logged in to contribute a new comment to a post. When a user clicks "login" in the navigation bar, they are brought to the login page. On the login page, a user may login with their credentials if they are an existing user in the database, otherwise they can submit new credentials to be added into the database as a new user. When the user submits their login/signup, they are brought to the user profile page. When the user is signed in, the navigation bar at the top includes links to the profile page and logout functionality. On the profile page, a user is presented a form for creating a new post, along with a list of posts that have been created by the user and buttons to edit or delete each post. Clicking on a post in this list with take the user to the post's page, where comments may be added. Clicking the edit button next to a user's post with take the user to the post update page, where a form is auto-filled with the post's existing information. The user may then change the information as desired and submit the form to commit the changes to the database.
